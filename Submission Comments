Hello Kelly!

You effectively demonstrated your cyber investigative tactics in this casino-based assignment!

We are truly impressed with the cohesive presentation of your analysis, especially in correlating the evidence. The Notes_Player_Analysis file meticulously outlines all losses on 3/10, 3/12, and 3/15, along with the corresponding times. It includes a note identifying Mylie Schmidt as a consistent player and provides Mylieâ€™s total loss count. Unfortunately, the Notes_Dealer_Analysis file, while present, lacks essential contents such as details of the dealer (-10 points) and their total loss count (-10 points). Nevertheless, the Player_Dealer_Correlation file features an excellent explanation of why Billy and Mylie are consistently at the same table!

Additionally, your scripted tasks for identifying the roulette dealer present at specific times were commendable. However, it is noted that your script wasn't executable, resulting in the inability to accept two arguments: a 4-digit date and time, leading to a deduction of 5 points.

This has been an impressive start to your 24-week journey; keep up the good work! -cs
